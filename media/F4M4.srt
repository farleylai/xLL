00:00:00.830->00:00:07.774
or… And letting her know I can go and pay.And she’s like, “Just, just hold on, let me, let me focus on this and we’ll talk in a minute when I get done writing.”

2
00:00:08.460->00:00:18.994
So then I start panicking, thinking, oh great, I am getting it, for sure. And I remember back to somebody telling me that they’d gotten one, a ticket once before on the train and, um,

3
00:00:19.960->00:00:31.274
for not havin’ their pass, and it ended up costing ‘em like 250 bucks…Well, I’ve gotten…And you know with the……one of those tickets before. And, and I mean, I recall it cost a pretty penny.But I don’t remember it being that much.

4
00:00:32.259->00:00:35.184
Well, eh, this is what I’m thinking it’s gonna cost. And

5
00:00:35.869->00:00:38.154
with the money that we’re tryin’ to save for our trip…

6
00:00:39.170->00:00:40.054
I just,

7
00:00:40.869->00:00:48.374
I almost started crying, thinkin’ I can’t afford this, y’know. So she finishes writing and hands it to me and

8
00:00:49.390->00:00:54.444
it ends up being only 50 bucks.
Oh, they must have cut down the fine then, because I remember I paid more than that.

9
00:00:55.229->00:01:09.524
Yeah, she had circled 50 bucks. She’s like ”I’m assuming this is your first offense.” And I was like “Yeah, it is.” She’s like “Okay, um, it’ll be 50 bucks. Now I did write down here that you do, you claim you have a pass and you just left it in a pair of pants back in your apartment.

10
00:01:10.719->00:01:17.114
So what you can do is go here. “ And she’s showing me all this on the ticket. “You can go here and contest it.

11
00:01:18.579->00:01:19.494
So…”
Pffft. Yeah..yeah,

12
00:01:20.269->00:01:23.344
go down there and contest it. That basically means you’re gonna spend,

13
00:01:23.909->00:01:31.404
y’know, most of a day sitting in the courtroom waiting for the case to get called. And then when it finally does get called

14
00:01:31.989->00:01:36.574
y’know, you gotta try and convince the judge that you actually had a ticket. I mean, it’s a total long shot.

15
00:01:37.379->00:01:40.254
I wouldn’t, I mean…
I know.I don’t even know, it’s a waste of time.

16
00:01:40.959->00:01:51.914
Yeah, I agree. I was talkin’ to somebody here at work about it and they were like, y’know, if you do that you’re gonna be sitting there for a few hours at least…Yeah.…and it’s just not worth it.No, I agree.

17
00:01:53.560->00:01:59.994
Yeah, so, I’m tryin’ not to have a chip on my shoulder about it. I don’t wanna badmouth them. I know they’re just doin’ their job…
