In the matlab shell, to segment a speech in the wave format, type:
>> main('media/F4M4', 0.5);

After the segmentation, an interactive prompt query to play particular speech segments.
>> What sentence to play(1-19)?
>> a: all, p: prev, n: next and q: quit

A subtitle F4M4.srt will be output to media/, marking the starts and lengths
of the segmented speech sentences.

Summary of source files.
media/              sample speech recordings
mfcc.m              the MFCC feature extraction
gmm.m               the GMM implementation
sdf.m               speech detection based on GMM
rfft.m              FFT to process only real samples
segment.m           merge adjacent silence and speech frames.
segments.m          expose speech segments given a silence threshold.

NOTE
Undocumented files are still experimental.
